<div class="disclaimer-scroll">
<p>By registering on the ChainEsport platform, players automatically agree to the following rules and policies. These ensure fair play, transparency, and compliance with EU MiCA regulations.</p>
<p><b>1. Agreement to Rules</b><br/>
Upon registration, every player agrees to abide by ChainEsport’s rules, disclaimers, and policies.<br/>
Participation is strictly limited to users 18+ who have passed KYC/AML verification.</p>
<p><b>2. Player Responsibility</b><br/>
ChainEsport provides the platform for skill-based competitions but does not guarantee opponent quality.<br/>
Players are responsible for verifying the identity and reputation of their opponents before starting a match.<br/>
Always check your opponent’s nickname, account history, and rank.<br/>
Newly created accounts, accounts with no history, or unusually low rank may indicate a higher risk of cheating.</p>
<p><b>3. No Liability for Opponent Behavior</b><br/>
ChainEsport does not control or influence gameplay.<br/>
ChainEsport is not responsible for opponents’ actions, behavior, or the use of third-party cheating software.<br/>
Match outcomes are based purely on player skill and performance within the game.</p>
<p><b>4. Recommendations for Safe Play</b><br/>
Prefer to play against opponents you know or who have a proven history in the game.<br/>
Avoid suspicious or unverified accounts.<br/>
Report suspicious activity immediately using the platform’s reporting tools.</p>
<p><b>5. Match Disputes &amp; Proof of Results</b><br/>
In the event of a dispute, the accusing player must provide proof in the form of:<br/>
- Screenshots or images (uploaded in the match chat).<br/>
- External video links (YouTube, Twitch, etc.).<br/>
Both winner and loser may upload supporting evidence.<br/>
ChainEsport administrators will review all submissions.<br/>
The administrator’s decision will be final and binding.<br/>
If no valid evidence is provided by either player within the dispute window, the match will be declared null and both players will have their entry fees returned minus a standard 2% service fee.<br/>
The 2% service fee is always applied as a charge for platform use, escrow processing, and dispute infrastructure, regardless of match outcome.<br/>
This fee is not a gambling rake or chance-based deduction. It is a transparent service charge for maintaining the ChainEsport platform, smart contract escrow, compliance, and fair-play systems, and is therefore independent of match results.</p>
<p><b>6. Anti-Cheat Enforcement</b><br/>
Any player found using cheats, hacks, or unauthorized third-party tools will be permanently banned.<br/>
Permanent bans apply to:<br/>
- Wallet address (blacklisted permanently)<br/>
- In-game nickname<br/>
- Email address<br/>
Banned players cannot register new accounts or pass KYC again.<br/>
Bans are final and irreversible.<br/>
ChainEsport enforces a zero-tolerance policy on cheating or exploit use.</p>
<p><b>7. Internet Connection &amp; Technical Issues</b><br/>
Each player is responsible for their own internet connection, hardware, and software.<br/>
Match losses due to technical issues (e.g., disconnects, hardware failure) are considered valid and final.<br/>
ChainEsport does not accept responsibility for such failures.<br/>
The opposing player will be considered the fair winner without appeal.</p>
<p><b>8. Non-Gambling, Skill-Based Only</b><br/>
ChainEsport operates exclusively as a skill-based competition platform.<br/>
Results are determined solely by player performance and submitted proof.<br/>
No chance, odds, or randomness are involved.<br/>
The platform is not gambling and is fully aligned with EU MiCA regulations.</p>
<p><b>9. Legal &amp; Compliance Disclaimer</b><br/>
ChainEsport provides infrastructure for player-versus-player competitions only.<br/>
ChainEsport does not guarantee fair play beyond its own enforcement measures.<br/>
By joining a match, players accept the risks of competing against unknown opponents.<br/>
Participation is restricted to 18+ verified individuals.</p>
<p><b>10. Final Disclaimers</b><br/>
ChainEsport provides infrastructure only and does not assume responsibility for:<br/>
- Player behavior during matches.<br/>
- Use of cheats (unless detected through disputes/admin review).<br/>
- Technical issues (lost connections, device failures, etc.).<br/>
By using the platform, players acknowledge these rules and accept full responsibility for their participation.</p>

<section class="card p-6 hidden" id="panel-whitepaper">
<h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold mb-4 text-center">Whitepaper</h2>
<div class="text-base whitespace-pre-line">CHAINESPORT
NO GAMBLING, NO CASINO, NO BETS, NO LOTTERY!
Only Fair Skill-Based Competitions where players, play against players!
Not another token project. Not another speculative play.

Executive Summary
We are creating the world’s first truly universal skill-based competition platform where:
Players can compete in any PvP game (Player vs Player) like CS:GO, PUBG, Warzone, Mortal Kombat, World of Tanks, FIFA, etc.) regardless of platform (PC, console, or mobile).
Players create and participate in skill-based competitions by contributing entry fees to a shared reward pool, which is automatically awarded to the winner through smart contracts. 

Non-Custodial Escrow System
ChainEsport is a non-custodial platform. Players always retain full control of their wallets. When entering a match, entry fees and prize pools are deposited directly into a smart contract escrow on the BNB Chain.
Funds remain locked until the match is completed, after which the escrow contract automatically releases payouts according to the submitted results.
This ensures that:
Player funds are never in company custody.
All flows are transparent and verifiable on-chain.
Funds cannot be commingled with company reserves.

Winners earn USDC instantly, directly to their wallets.
ChainEsport applies a small 2% service fee on each competition entry. This fee supports platform operations, security, and infrastructure while ensuring a sustainable service-fee model for both the company and participating Node Holders.
ChainEsport is not just a gaming project, this is the bridge that brings millions of gamers into crypto — through a real, sustainable use case.

The Gaming Industry Today
Every day, hundreds of millions of players around the world spend money on: Buying new games.
Purchasing updates, DLCs, and season passes. Acquiring skins, weapons, and cosmetic upgrades.
The global gaming industry is worth over $200 billion annually, yet only a tiny fraction of players ever make any real money from gaming. The vast majority simply spend without a return.

Problem &amp; Opportunity
Traditional eSports prize pools are limited to pro players — 99% of gamers never earn.
Existing platforms are centralized, have high withdrawal fees, and are not trustless.
Gambling laws block many potential users — we focus on skill-based legal frameworks.
No existing platform offers true multi-game, cross-network, real-money skill-based eSports tournaments.

The Market Potential
3.4B gamers worldwide → 65M PvP online gamers in the EU.
Even if just 1% of EU competitive gamers join, that’s 2.5M active users. This creates a multi-hundred-million-dollar annual fee revenue opportunity.
Every player onboarding means a new crypto wallet, new USDC user, new blockchain participant.
ChainEsport becomes a gateway into crypto for a massive audience who has never touched it before.

Why This Will Change the Industry
For the first time in history, gaming will not just be entertainment — it will be a profession for millions.
Players will monetize their skills, not just their time.
The platform is fully scalable, crossing game genres, platforms, and geographies.

Why Node Holders Should Join Early
First-mover advantage: no other platform combines cross-game, cross-platform, skill-based esports + USDC blockchain payouts.
Regulatory-first approach: built under MiCA in Latvia, fully compliant, KYC/AML integrated.
Real business model: 2% fee on every match → transparent service-fee distribution model.
The global gaming market continues to expand rapidly — your early participation aligns with a long-term platform growth strategy..</div>

• Match losses due to technical issues (e.g., disconnects, hardware failure) are considered valid and final.
• ChainEsport does not accept responsibility for such failures.
• The opposing player will be considered the fair winner without appeal.

8. Non-Gambling, Skill-Based Only
• ChainEsport operates exclusively as a skill-based competition platform.
